# DatabaseMovieRecommender
I have used MongoDB and KNN to build a movie recommender system and save all the movie recommends of a particular person on the database along with their favourite movie .
I have used scikit and pandas for making the machine learning model .I have used fuzzywuzzy which helps me find a simillar movie to the one user has entered ,the dataset has been taken from movie lens I have not used brute force comparison as the curse of dimensionality may become evident.
distance metric can be choosen by the user
