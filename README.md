# DatabaseMovieRecommender
I have used MongoDB and KNN to build a movie recommender system and save all the movie recommends of a particular person on the database along with their favourite movie 
one
I have used scikit and pandas for making the machine learning model 
I have used fuzzywuzzy which helps me find a simillar movie to the one user has entered 
dataset has been taken from movie lens 
we have not used brute force comparison as the curse of dimensionality may become evident as we use it as there are a lot of dimensions 
distance metric can be editted by the user
